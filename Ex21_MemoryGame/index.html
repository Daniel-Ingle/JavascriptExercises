      Tile Memory Game
    </p>
    <p>
      This game is a tile game where letters are underneath the tiles.
      A player selects two tiles and, if they match, they stay opened.
      Otherwise, if they don't match, the tiles are flipped closed again
      and the player selects two more to select matching tiles.  The 
      player wins when all of the tiles have been flipped over.  Score
      is based on how quiclky they were able to match all of the tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic game setup and mechanics has already been set up in 
      app.js.  <strong>TODO:</strong> You need to set up what happens
      when a player selects two cards:
      <ol>
        <li>Only have them open up to two cards at a time</li>
        <li>If the two cards that are open 'match,' then leave them open</li>
        <li>If they don't match, 'close' them</li>
        <li>Determine if the game is over; that is, when all the cards are 'open'</li>
      </ol>
