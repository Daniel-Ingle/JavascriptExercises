      This will help you calculate your tip, based on your total bill and the
      amount you want to tip, from 0% to 30%.  The "Tip" slider allows you to
      select a value in the range of 0 through 30 as its value.  
      The ".value" property of this input will return that value as a number, 0 to 30.  
      Tip amount should be "Total Bill" times the "Tip" as a percent (the value of 
      the input divided by 100), and the Total with Tip is this plus
      the original "Total Bill".
    </p>
    Hints:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The slider is an input type, with a value based on the values 0 to 30. You
        can get the value just as if it were a regular "text" or "number" input.        
      </li>
      <li>
        The tip isn't the value of the range input field, it is the value / 100, to 
        make it a percentage.
      </li>
      <li>
        We'll need to handle the 'change' events on both the input range field for the
        tip, <b>plus</b> the Total Bill input.  The listeners have been provided, but
        you'll need to create your own function.
      </li>
      <li>
        When either of the input fields at the top change, you should recalculate the Tip
        Amount and Total with Tip, placing the results as the value for the
      </li>
      <li>
        When getting values from the input fields, or adding them together, you may need
        to convert them from a string using the parseInt() function.  Otherwise you might
        get weird results like "5" + "25" = "525"
      </li>
