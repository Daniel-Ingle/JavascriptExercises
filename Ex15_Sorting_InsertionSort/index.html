      Given an array of 'n' elements, we need to sort the elements.  For our
      cities in Montana, we want to sort them alphabetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll do this using a <strong>Bubble Sort</strong> algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works by comparing the city at index 0 with the city at
      index 1 and, if the city at index 1 should come before, it 
      <strong>swaps</strong> those two elements. Then, the 
      city now at index 1 is compared with the city at index 2, and
      again index 1 and index 2 are swapped if 2 should come before 1.
      And on through to index <b>array.length - 1</b>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      But, we need to iterate again, this time only going through 
      to the next-to-last element in the array, since we will have
      already "pushed" last city to the end.  So the next
      iteration only goes to <b>array.length - 1 - 1</b>.  And we 
      do it again, up to <b>array.length - 2 - 1</b>, and again, 
      and again, all the way up to <b>array.length - array.length - 1</b>.
    </p>

      Here is  an illustration using numbers rather than cities:
