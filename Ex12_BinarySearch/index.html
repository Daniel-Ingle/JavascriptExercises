    This exercise has been solved for you.  
    Take a look at the code and try to understand what is happening.

      Given an array of 'n' elements and a target element 'target', find the <strong>index</strong>
      of 'target' in the array.  Return -1 if the target element is not found. For example, the
      index for "Belgrade" would be "4"
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this time, we'll use a "Binary Search."  A binary search assumes our
      array is already sorted, in our case, it is sorted alphabetically.  This allows
      us to perform the following algorithm:
      <ol>
        <li>If the array has elements, find the middle element in the array.</li>
        <li>If the target is equal to the middle element, return that element's index.</li>
        <li>
          If target is "less than" (i.e., comes before) the middle element, binary
          search the left half of the array.
        </li>
        <li>
          If target is "greater than" (i.e., comes after) the middle element, binary
          search the right half of the array.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In our example, we'll use a list of Cities in Montana as the array of elements,
      and the target will be the search item.  For example, "Baker" is the third city
      in our list, Baker's index is "2" (since the index is zero-based, i.e., the first
      city, Anaconda, is array index "0").
